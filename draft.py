CSP final Project rough draft
something like pseudo code, just a rough idea so the program does not actually work

    open file and store each coutry to the list

def SortbyName(self):
    here i would use a merge sort which would also use recursion

def SearchbySymbol(self):
    use a binary search recurcive binary search
    
def drawMap(self,lists of data)
    here I would import a module that I have written which is supposed to
    draw out or point out each countries Sort of drwing a map
    (this would get me the marks for module)
